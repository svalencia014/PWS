    I am a high school student from Indianapolis, IN who is currently studying to become a software engineer. I am currently
    looking for freelance opportunities to help increase my experience in the field while also helping to get me on my feet
    after I finish high school. My end goal is to end up living in rural Indiana, preferably in the southern part of the state,
    doing work remotely with a side hustle of horse farming (which is really profitable in Indiana).
    <br>
    <br>
    I have been programming for about 4 years now, with my first language being python, mainly to automate tasks or mess around 
    with friends. In 2021, I learned JavaScript and in 2023, I learned TypeScript and Svelte. My main stack currently is SvelteKit
    for frontend work and typescript for backend work or any Node.js project. I'm also familiar with Go and Rust, although I don't
    know as much as I do in JS and TS. I have also used Tauri for a few projects, mainly since it's easy to create a UI with it. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Outside of school and programming, I like to play video games <i>(Which I usually post on YouTube found on my <a href="/socials">socials</a> page)</i>, 
    take pictures, and do <i><a href="/vatsim">Virtual Air Traffic Controlling</a></i>. I also have found an interest in horseback riding 
    <i>(I'm from Indiana, what did you expect)</i>, although I don't do it as much as I would like to.
